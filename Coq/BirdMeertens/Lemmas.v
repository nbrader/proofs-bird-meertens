(* Extended integers with negative infinity for proper max monoid *)
(*
   The Z_plus_neg_inf type addresses the fundamental issue with your original
   fold_right_max_returns_max lemma. The problem was that fold_right Z.max 0
   doesn't form a proper monoid because:

   1. With identity 0, the result might not be in the original list
      (e.g., [-5; -3; -1] gives max = 0, but 0 ∉ [-5; -3; -1])

   2. The lemma required both non-negativity constraints AND membership,
      making it impossible to prove in the general case.

   With Z_plus_neg_inf and NegInf as the proper identity:
   - fold_right_max_inf ALWAYS returns an element from the list (when non-empty)
   - No non-negativity constraints needed
   - Works for any list of integers including all-negative lists

   Key lemmas:
   - fold_right_max_inf_in: Result is always in the original list
   - fold_right_max_inf_returns_max: General version without non-negativity
