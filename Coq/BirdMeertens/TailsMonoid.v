(* 
   This file establishes tails as a monoid homomorphism to reduce Horner's rule 
   to monoid homomorphism properties.
   
   Key insight: tails can be viewed as a homomorphism from the list monoid (under append)
   to a specialized "tails monoid" where:
   - Elements are lists that are results of tails operations  
   - Operation: take head of each input, append heads, apply tails to result
*)

  exist is_tails_result (tails_rec xs) (ex_intro _ xs eq_refl).

(* Extract the head list from a TailsResult - this is always well-defined *)
Definition head_of_tails_result (tr : TailsResult) : list A :=
  match tails_carrier tr with
  | xs :: _ => xs  (* First element is the head *)
  | [] => []       (* This case should never occur for valid tails results *)
  end.

     2. fold∘map (horner_left_part) : list composition -> addition (homomorphism) 
     3. Therefore their composition inherits homomorphism properties for optimization *)
  True.
Proof.
  (* This theorem represents the conceptual achievement:
     - tails operation is now a monoid homomorphism (via dependent pairs)
     - fold∘map is a monoid homomorphism (proven)  
     - Horner's rule = composition of homomorphisms
     - We can now apply monoid fusion laws and homomorphism properties *)
