(* Allows us to expand a left fold as if it were a right fold, provided the operation allows a form of commutativity. *)

(* Let me approach this more carefully by understanding what we need to prove *)
(* scan_right f i (x::xs') = f x (fold_right f i xs') :: scan_right f i xs' *)
(* tails (x::xs') should give us (x::xs') :: tails xs' *)
(* So map (fold_right f i) (tails (x::xs')) should give us *)
(* fold_right f i (x::xs') :: map (fold_right f i) (tails xs') *)

(* Let me try a different approach - prove by computation for small examples first *)
(* and then try to generalize the pattern *)

(* Simple computational lemma for concrete small cases *)

(* Now let me try the main theorem with a more direct computational approach *)
Example scan_right_tails_example :

  (* The key insight is that fold_right ... xs is never [], and the first element should be xs *)
  
  (* This is actually quite complex because we need to prove structural properties about this fold_right *)
  (* Let me try a different approach - prove it directly for the tails function *)
Admitted.

(* Final attempt: prove tails_cons by working with the fold_right structure systematically *)

  (* After simpl, I get:

  - (* Case: tails xs = first_tail :: rest_tails *)
    (* I need: (x :: first_tail) :: (first_tail :: rest_tails) = (x :: xs) :: (first_tail :: rest_tails) *)
    (* This means I need: x :: first_tail = x :: xs, so first_tail = xs *)
