  (* The key insight: we need to show the inner functions are equal *)
  apply functional_extensionality.
  intro xs.
  unfold compose.
  (* Now the goal is: nonNegMaximum (map (fold_right nonNegPlus 0) (tails_rec xs)) = nonNegMaximum (scan_right nonNegPlus 0 xs) *)
  (* We need to lift the list-level equality to the nonNegMaximum level *)
  f_equal.
