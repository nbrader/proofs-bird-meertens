(*
SUMMARY: Alternative Proof Status

The theorem maxsegsum_alternative_proof provides an alternative proof route to
nonneg_tropical_fold_right_returns_max by using case-based reasoning:

✅ COMPLETE COMPONENTS:
- Case trichotomy (all_nonnegative | all_nonpositive | mixed_signs)
- All non-negative case: Direct proof using monotonicity properties
- All non-positive case: Direct proof using clamping behavior
- Main theorem framework: Compiles and combines all cases

❌ INCOMPLETE COMPONENTS:
- Mixed case proof: Uses sophisticated tropical semiring theory (Admitted)
- Supporting lemmas: maximum_equivalence_in_mixed_case (Admitted)

🎯 SIGNIFICANCE:
This provides a structured alternative to the existing tropical semiring proof,
with 2/3 cases complete. The framework demonstrates how tropical semiring
properties can be applied case-by-case rather than uniformly.

The mixed case completion requires deep tropical semiring theory but the
overall approach is mathematically sound and provides valuable insights
into the structure of Kadane's algorithm correctness.
