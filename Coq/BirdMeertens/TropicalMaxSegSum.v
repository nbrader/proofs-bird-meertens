  - reflexivity.
  - (* This connects the Z-based nonNegSum to the tropical semiring computation *)
    (* The key is that when the sum is non-negative, no clamping occurs *)

    (* Step 1: Apply the tropical Horner's rule *)
    (* The tropical_horners_rule theorem from SemiringLemmas.v states:
       fold_right (fun x y => (x ⊗ y) ⊕ 𝟏) 𝟏 = fold_right add_op add_zero ∘ map (fold_right mul_op mul_one) ∘ inits

       For the ExtZ tropical semiring:
       - (x ⊗ y) = tropical_mul x y = Finite (Z.add (unwrap x) (unwrap y))
       - (x ⊕ y) = tropical_add x y = Finite (Z.max (unwrap x) (unwrap y))
       - 𝟏 = mul_one = Finite 0
       - 𝟎 = add_zero = NegInf
    *)

    (* Step 2: Bridge to Z operations *)
    (* The key insight: when nonNegSum xs >= 0, the tropical computation
       on Finite values corresponds exactly to Z operations:
       - tropical_add (Finite a) (Finite b) = Finite (Z.max a b)
       - tropical_mul (Finite a) (Finite b) = Finite (Z.add a b)
       - And crucially: nonNegSum behaves like regular sum when result >= 0

    (* Step 3: Complete the bridge *)
    (* This requires detailed proofs about:
       1. Z_to_ExtZ preserves the algebraic structure
       2. Correspondence between nonNegSum and tropical computation
       3. Properties of inits and map under the correspondence
