Lemma maxsegsum_mixed_case : forall xs : list Z,

Proof.
  intros xs H_mixed.

  (* First, let's unfold the definitions to see what we're actually proving *)
  unfold nonNegSum, nonNegMaximum.

  (* Goal becomes:
     fold_right nonNegPlus 0 xs = fold_right Z.max 0 (map (fold_right nonNegPlus 0) (inits xs)) *)

  (* Now apply tropical_horners_rule *)
  assert (H_tropical := tropical_horners_rule).
  unfold compose in H_tropical.

  (* tropical_horners_rule states:
     fold_right (fun x y => (x ⊗ y) ⊕ 𝟏) 𝟏 = fold_right ⊕ 𝟎 ∘ map (fold_right ⊗ 𝟏) ∘ inits

     With tropical semiring: ⊗ = +, ⊕ = max, 𝟏 = 0, 𝟎 = -∞ (but we use 0 for finite values)

     This gives us:
     fold_right (fun x y => max (x + y) 0) 0 = fold_right max 0 ∘ map (fold_right + 0) ∘ inits

     But fold_right (fun x y => max (x + y) 0) 0 = fold_right nonNegPlus 0
     And fold_right + 0 on non-negative results = fold_right nonNegPlus 0 when result >= 0
  *)

  (* Key insight: The correspondence is almost exact! *)
  (* tropical_horners_rule gives us:
     fold_right nonNegPlus 0 = fold_right max 0 ∘ map (fold_right + 0) ∘ inits

     But we need:
     fold_right nonNegPlus 0 = fold_right max 0 ∘ map (fold_right nonNegPlus 0) ∘ inits

     The difference is: fold_right + 0 vs fold_right nonNegPlus 0 inside the map
  *)

  (* Bridge: In mixed case, for prefixes whose sum will contribute to the maximum,
     fold_right + 0 = fold_right nonNegPlus 0 because the final result is >= 0 *)

       - ⊗ = Z.add (tropical multiplication)
       - 1 (multiplicative identity) = 0
       - 0 (additive identity) = negative infinity, but we use 0 for finite computations
       - (x ⊗ y) ⊕ 1 = max(x + y, 0) = nonNegPlus x y

    StructSemiring.mul_one) StructSemiring.mul_one).
