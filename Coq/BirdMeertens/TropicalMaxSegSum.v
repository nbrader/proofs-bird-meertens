(* Helper lemmas for case analysis *)
Lemma case_trichotomy : forall xs : list Z,
  all_nonnegative xs \/ all_nonpositive xs \/ mixed_signs xs.
Proof.
  intro xs.
  (* Case analysis can be implemented constructively, but for now we admit *)

Lemma nonNegSum_monotonic_nonneg : forall xs ys : list Z,
  all_nonnegative xs ->
  all_nonnegative ys ->
  (exists zs, ys = xs ++ zs) ->
  nonNegSum xs <= nonNegSum ys.
Proof.

  rewrite H_app.
  unfold nonNegSum.

  (* When xs is non-negative, nonNegSum xs >= 0, so adding more non-negative elements increases the sum *)
  admit. (* TODO: Complete this proof *)
Admitted.

(* Case 1: All non-negative - max subarray is entire array *)
Lemma maxsegsum_all_nonnegative : forall xs : list Z,
  all_nonnegative xs ->
  nonNegSum xs = nonNegMaximum (map nonNegSum (inits xs)).
Proof.
  intros xs H_nonneg.
  (* Use the existing proof strategy but leverage monotonicity for non-negative case *)
  apply (equal_f nonneg_tropical_fold_right_returns_max xs).
  (* The existing proof works regardless of the sign pattern *)
  (* but in the non-negative case, we have additional nice properties *)

(* Case 2: All non-positive - max subarray is singleton of largest element *)
Lemma maxsegsum_all_nonpositive : forall xs : list Z,
  all_nonpositive xs ->
  nonNegSum xs = nonNegMaximum (map nonNegSum (inits xs)).
Proof.
  intros xs H_nonpos.
  (* When all elements are non-positive, nonNegSum clamps to 0 *)

(* Case 3: Mixed signs - use tropical Horner's rule connection *)
Lemma maxsegsum_mixed_case : forall xs : list Z,
  mixed_signs xs ->
  nonNegSum xs = nonNegMaximum (map nonNegSum (inits xs)).
Proof.
  intros xs H_mixed.
  (* In the mixed case, nonNegSum xs >= 0 by definition (nonNegSum always returns >= 0) *)
  (* This allows us to bridge to the tropical semiring framework *)

  (* First establish that nonNegSum xs >= 0 *)
  assert (H_nonneg: nonNegSum xs >= 0).

  (* Use the tropical bridge to connect to ExtZ computation *)

  (* Apply the tropical Horner's rule result *)
  (* The existing proof works, but this demonstrates the connection to tropical algebra *)
