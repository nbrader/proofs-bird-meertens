Lemma case_trichotomy : forall xs : list Z,

Proof.

Admitted.

(* Helper: nonNegSum is monotonic on non-negative sequences *)
Lemma nonNegSum_monotonic_nonneg : forall xs ys : list Z,
  all_nonnegative xs ->
  all_nonnegative ys ->
  (exists zs, ys = xs ++ zs) ->
  nonNegSum xs <= nonNegSum ys.
Proof.
  intros xs ys H_xs_nonneg H_ys_nonneg [zs H_app].
  (* This proof requires careful handling of nonNegPlus properties *)

Admitted.

(* Case 1: All non-negative - max subarray is entire array *)
Lemma maxsegsum_all_nonnegative : forall xs : list Z,
  all_nonnegative xs ->
  nonNegSum xs = nonNegMaximum (map nonNegSum (inits xs)).
Proof.

  (* Use the existing proof strategy but leverage monotonicity for non-negative case *)
  apply (equal_f nonneg_tropical_fold_right_returns_max xs).
  (* The existing proof works regardless of the sign pattern *)
  (* but in the non-negative case, we have additional nice properties *)
Qed.

(* Case 2: All non-positive - max subarray is singleton of largest element *)
Lemma maxsegsum_all_nonpositive : forall xs : list Z,
  all_nonpositive xs ->
  nonNegSum xs = nonNegMaximum (map nonNegSum (inits xs)).
Proof.
  intros xs H_nonpos.

(* Key insight: When maximum subarray sum >= 0, we can use tropical Horner's rule *)
Lemma tropical_bridge : forall xs : list Z,
  nonNegSum xs >= 0 ->
  exists (exs : list ExtZ),
    list_Z_to_ExtZ xs = exs /\
    Finite (nonNegSum xs) = fold_right tropical_add NegInf (map (fold_right tropical_mul (Finite 0)) (inits exs)).
Proof.
  intros xs H_nonneg_sum.
  exists (list_Z_to_ExtZ xs).
  split.
  - reflexivity.
  - (* This connects the Z-based nonNegSum to the tropical semiring computation *)
    (* The key is that when the sum is non-negative, no clamping occurs *)

    (* Step 1: Apply the tropical Horner's rule *)
    (* The tropical_horners_rule theorem from SemiringLemmas.v states:
       fold_right (fun x y => (x ⊗ y) ⊕ 𝟏) 𝟏 = fold_right add_op add_zero ∘ map (fold_right mul_op mul_one) ∘ inits

       For the ExtZ tropical semiring:
       - (x ⊗ y) = tropical_mul x y = Finite (Z.add (unwrap x) (unwrap y))
       - (x ⊕ y) = tropical_add x y = Finite (Z.max (unwrap x) (unwrap y))
       - 𝟏 = mul_one = Finite 0
       - 𝟎 = add_zero = NegInf
    *)

    (* Step 2: Bridge to Z operations *)
    (* The key insight: when nonNegSum xs >= 0, the tropical computation
       on Finite values corresponds exactly to Z operations:
       - tropical_add (Finite a) (Finite b) = Finite (Z.max a b)
       - tropical_mul (Finite a) (Finite b) = Finite (Z.add a b)
       - And crucially: nonNegSum behaves like regular sum when result >= 0
    *)

    (* Step 3: Complete the bridge *)
    (* This requires detailed proofs about:
       1. Z_to_ExtZ preserves the algebraic structure
       2. Correspondence between nonNegSum and tropical computation
       3. Properties of inits and map under the correspondence
    *)

    admit. (* The complete proof would establish this correspondence in detail *)
Admitted.

(* Case 3: Mixed signs - use tropical Horner's rule connection *)
Lemma maxsegsum_mixed_case : forall xs : list Z,
  mixed_signs xs ->
  nonNegSum xs = nonNegMaximum (map nonNegSum (inits xs)).
Proof.
  intros xs H_mixed.
  (* In the mixed case, nonNegSum xs >= 0 by definition (nonNegSum always returns >= 0) *)
  (* This allows us to bridge to the tropical semiring framework *)

  (* First establish that nonNegSum xs >= 0 *)
  assert (H_nonneg: nonNegSum xs >= 0).
  { (* nonNegSum always returns non-negative values by definition *)
