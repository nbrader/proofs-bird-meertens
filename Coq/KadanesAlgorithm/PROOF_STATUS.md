## Overview

This directory contains a complete, generalized proof of Kadane's algorithm correctness using semiring theory.

## File Status

### KadanesAlgorithm.v

**Generalized semiring-based proof** (works for ANY semiring):

- ✓ `gform1_eq_gform2` through `gform4_eq_gform5` - Basic transformations
- ✓ `gform5_eq_gform6` - Horner's rule (requires `generalised_horners_rule_right`)
- ✓ `gform6_eq_gform7` - Scan relationship
- ✓ `gform7_eq_gform8` - Fold-scan fusion
- ✓ `Generalized_Kadane_Correctness` - Main theorem: gform1 = gform8

**Tropical semiring instance** (max-plus operations):

- ✓ All tropical semiring axioms proven
- ✓ `TropicalSemiring` instance defined
- ✓ `max_subarray_sum` defined using gform8
- ✓ `max_subarray_correct` - Correctness theorem

### NaturalKadane.v

**Natural numbers semiring instance**:

- ✓ All natural number semiring axioms
- ✓ `NaturalSemiring` instance defined
- ✓ Example computations verified

### MaxSubarrayComplete.v

**Concrete maximum subarray algorithm with correctness proof**:

- ✓ `tropical_gform1_is_max_subarray` - Connects tropical gform1 to max subarray spec
- ✓ `all_nonpositive_max_is_singleton` - All-nonpositive case correctness
- ✓ `kadanes_algorithm_correct` - Main theorem: kadanes_algorithm = max_subarray_sum_spec

## Summary

All files proven with 0 Admitted statements:
- ✓ Generalized framework (ANY semiring)
- ✓ Tropical semiring instance
- ✓ Natural numbers instance
- ✓ Concrete integer algorithm with full correctness proof

**Key Achievement**: Kadane's algorithm proven correct via pure semiring theory, with no additional assumptions beyond standard semiring axioms.

**Main Theorem**: For the tropical semiring (max as ⊕, addition as ⊗), Kadane's efficient algorithm (gform8) computes the same result as the specification (gform1 = max of sums over all segments).
