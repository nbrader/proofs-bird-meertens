COMPLETE KADANE'S ALGORITHM WITH CORRECTNESS PROOF
=================================================================================

This file defines a complete, practical version of Kadane's algorithm that:
1. Handles all-nonpositive inputs by returning the maximum single element
2. Handles inputs with positive elements using the semiring-based algorithm
3. Is proven correct by connecting form8 (efficient) to form1 (specification)

STRATEGY:
- Prove that gform1 (from tropical semiring) matches the plain-English spec
- Use the proven equivalence gform1 = gform8 from TropicalKadane.v
- Handle the all-nonpositive case separately (max single element)
- Combine both cases into a complete algorithm

GOAL:
Show that the efficient algorithm correctly computes:
  "the maximum sum among all contiguous subarrays"
*)

(* TODO: This requires showing that:

   2. semiring_product with ExtZ addition gives us the sum
   3. The composition computes max sum over all segments

CORRECTNESS THEOREM
=================================================================================

Theorem kadanes_algorithm_correct : forall xs : list Z,
  kadanes_algorithm xs = max_subarray_sum_spec xs.

PROOF STRATEGY:
1. Case: xs = []
   - Trivial: both return 0

2. Case: all_nonpositive xs = true
   - Show max_element xs = maximum single element
   - Show maximum subarray in all-nonpositive case is a single element
   - Therefore max_element xs = max_subarray_sum_spec xs

3. Case: all_nonpositive xs = false (has positive elements)
   - Use form8 from TropicalKadane.v (the efficient algorithm)
   - Use proven equivalence: gform1 = gform8 from Generalized_Kadane_Correctness
   - Prove gform1 xs = max_subarray_sum_spec xs (form1 is the spec!)
   - Conclude: form8 xs = max_subarray_sum_spec xs

The key insight: gform1 (specification form) IS almost the same as our plain-English
spec - it's literally "sum of products over all segments" which for tropical semiring
means "max of sums over all segments" = maximum subarray sum!

NOTES FOR COMPLETION
=================================================================================

To complete this file, we need to:

1. Define proper conversion between ExtZ (from TropicalKadane.v) and Z
   - extZ_to_Z : ExtZ -> Z
   - Handle NegInf appropriately (probably map to most negative value or 0)

2. Extract the actual form8 implementation from TropicalKadane.v
   - tropical_gform8 : list Z -> ExtZ
   - Wrap it: kadanes_form8 : list Z -> Z := extZ_to_Z ∘ tropical_gform8

3. Prove tropical_gform1_is_max_subarray
   - Show semiring_sum with max ≡ maximum
   - Show semiring_product with + ≡ sum
   - Show composition ≡ max sum over segments

4. Complete all_nonpositive_max_is_singleton proof
   - Show adding negative numbers decreases sum
   - Therefore optimal subarray in all-nonpositive case is singleton
   - That singleton is the maximum element

5. Complete the main theorem using the above lemmas and the proven equivalences

The beauty of this approach: We leverage the fully general semiring proof
and only need to prove the "interpretation" - that the tropical semiring
operations actually compute what we want (max of sums).
