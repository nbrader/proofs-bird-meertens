## Detailed Analysis

### Level 1: Direct Dependencies of MaxSegSum_Equivalence

**From `Print Assumptions MaxSegSum_Equivalence` (omitting standard axiom functional_extensionality_dep):**

1. **`form5_eq_form6`** - ADMITTED theorem
2. **`form7_eq_form8`** - ADMITTED theorem  
3. **`ListFunctions.tails_rec_equiv`** - ADMITTED theorem (through form6_eq_form7)

### Level 2 & 3: Transitive Dependencies

#### form5_eq_form6 Dependencies
**From `Print Assumptions form5_eq_form6`:**
- **`generalised_horners_rule`** - ADMITTED theorem ⭐ LEAF

#### form7_eq_form8 Dependencies  
**From `Print Assumptions form7_eq_form8`:**
- **`fold_scan_fusion`** - ADMITTED theorem ⭐ LEAF

#### form6_eq_form7 Dependencies Path
**Dependency Chain:**
1. **`form6_eq_form7`** - COMPLETED (BirdMeertens.v:77, ends with Qed)
2. **`scan_right_tails_fold`** - ADMITTED theorem (ListFunctions.v:283)
3. **`tails_rec_equiv`** - ADMITTED theorem ⭐ LEAF (ListFunctions.v:173)

**From `Print Assumptions form6_eq_form7` (omitting standard axiom functional_extensionality_dep):**
- **`ListFunctions.tails_rec_equiv`** - ADMITTED theorem

**From `Print Assumptions scan_right_tails_fold`:**
- **`tails_rec_equiv`** - ADMITTED theorem

**From `Print Assumptions tails_rec_equiv`:**
- **No further dependencies** - This is a base structural axiom

## Critical Path Analysis

### Total Admitted Theorems Required: 4 ⬇️ (Reduced from 5)

1. **`generalised_horners_rule`** ⭐ **LEAF DEPENDENCY**
   - Location: `Lemmas.v:237` 
   - Type: Mathematical theorem about fold equivalences over inits
   - Status: Complex inductive proof required

2. **`fold_scan_fusion`** ⭐ **LEAF DEPENDENCY**  
   - Location: `Lemmas.v:409`
   - Type: Advanced scan-fold relationship theorem
   - Status: Sophisticated algebraic proof required

3. **`form5_eq_form6`** 
   - Location: `BirdMeertens.v:62`
   - Depends on: `generalised_horners_rule`
   - Type: High-level form transformation

4. **`form7_eq_form8`**
   - Location: `BirdMeertens.v:90` 
   - Depends on: `fold_scan_fusion`
   - Type: High-level form transformation

## ✅ ELIMINATED DEPENDENCY
- **`ListFunctions.tails_rec_equiv`** - **NO LONGER NEEDED** 
  - **Strategy**: Rephrased `form6` to use `tails_rec` directly instead of `tails`
  - **Impact**: Eliminated complex structural equivalence proof requirement
  - **Result**: `form6_eq_form7` now proven directly using `scan_right_tails_rec_fold`

## Completion Strategy

### Priority 1: Leaf Dependencies (⭐)
These are the foundational theorems that don't depend on other admitted proofs:

1. **`generalised_horners_rule`** - Mathematical foundation
2. **`fold_scan_fusion`** - Algebraic foundation  
3. **`tails_rec_equiv`** - Structural foundation

### Priority 2: Dependent Theorems
Once the leaf dependencies are proven:

4. **`form5_eq_form6`** - Can be completed using `generalised_horners_rule`
5. **`form7_eq_form8`** - Can be completed using `fold_scan_fusion`

## Impact Analysis

- **Blocking Effect**: All 5 admitted theorems must be resolved to complete `MaxSegSum_Equivalence`
- **Critical Path**: The 3 leaf dependencies are the fundamental blockers
- **Dependency Depth**: Maximum depth is 2 levels (MaxSegSum_Equivalence → form → base theorem)
- **Parallel Opportunities**: The 3 leaf dependencies can be worked on independently

## Current Status

- **Completed Theorems**: `form6_eq_form7` (uses `tails_rec_equiv` but compiles successfully)
- **Total Remaining Work**: 5 admitted theorems requiring proof completion
- **Estimated Complexity**: High - all remaining theorems are sophisticated mathematical results

## Recommendations

1. **Focus on leaf dependencies first** - they unblock multiple downstream theorems
2. **Consider `tails_rec_equiv`** as potentially the most tractable structural proof
3. **Mathematical theorems** (`generalised_horners_rule`, `fold_scan_fusion`) may require domain expertise
4. **Use FreeMonoid library** - could provide theoretical framework for fold-related proofs
