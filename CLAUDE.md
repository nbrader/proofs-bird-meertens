# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a Coq formalization project that translates theorem from the Bird-Meertens Formalism Wikipedia article about the correctness of Kadane's algorithm for the Maximum subarray problem.

## Essential Commands

### Building the Project
- `./build_coq.sh` - Primary build command (run from the Coq/ directory)
- If line endings are problematic: `dos2unix build_coq.sh` first
- The build script generates a Makefile from `_CoqProject` and runs `make`

### Development Setup
- Requires Visual Studio Code (1.94.2) with VsCoq extension (v2.1.2)
- Open the folder containing `.v` files directly in VSCode (not parent folders) for proper file resolution
- May require submodule initialization after cloning: run "Submodule Update"

### Python Analysis Tools
- `python Python/references.py` - Generates dependency graph in TGF format
- `python Python/summarize_dependencies.py` - Analyzes Coq dependencies

## Code Architecture

### Coq Structure
The main Coq development is in `Coq/BirdMeertens/` with four key modules:

1. **ListFunctions.v** - Core list manipulation functions (`tails`, `inits`, `segs`, `scan_right`, etc.)
2. **Lemmas.v** - Mathematical definitions and operations (`nonNegPlus`, `nonNegSum`, `nonNegMaximum`) 
3. **FunctionLemmas.v** - Supporting lemmas for functions
4. **BirdMeertens.v** - Main theorem proving Kadane's algorithm correctness through 8 equivalent forms

### Module Dependencies
- `BirdMeertens.v` imports `Lemmas.v` and `ListFunctions.v`
- `Lemmas.v` imports `ListFunctions.v` and `FunctionLemmas.v`
- All modules use standard Coq libraries (Program.Basics, Lists.List, ZArith, etc.)

### Key Mathematical Concepts
The project proves equivalence through transformational forms:
- `form1` through `form8` represent different but equivalent formulations
- Each form transformation is proven as a separate theorem
- Final form (`form8`) represents Kadane's efficient algorithm

### Supporting Languages
- **Haskell/** - Reference implementations and benchmarking
- **Python/** - Analysis tools for dependency tracking and visualization
- **Rough Working/** - Development notes and diagrams

The project structure allows for cross-language validation of the formal Coq proofs against executable Haskell implementations.

### Remaining Admitted Proofs Analysis

Current total admitted proofs: **8** (as of 2025-09-13)

**RECENTLY COMPLETED:**
- âœ… **`scan_lemma` in `Lemmas.v:408-412`** - **COMPLETED**
- âœ… **`form6_eq_form7` in `BirdMeertens.v:88`** - **COMPLETED** (using auxiliary lemma)
- âœ… **New utility lemmas in `ListFunctions.v`** - **4 COMPLETED**:
  - `scan_right_singleton` (line 159-164) - scan_right behavior on single elements
  - `scan_right_nil` (line 166-171) - scan_right behavior on empty lists  
  - `tails_nil` (line 173-177) - tails behavior on empty lists
  - `tails_singleton` (line 179-183) - tails behavior on single elements

**CURRENT TECHNICAL CHALLENGE - CORE STRUCTURAL ISSUE:**

The main blocker preventing further proof completion is a fundamental **structural property problem with the `tails` function**. The `tails` function is defined using a complex `fold_right` pattern:

```coq
Definition tails {A : Type}: list A -> list (list A) := fold_right (fun x xsxss => match xsxss with
  | [] => [[]] (* This case is impossible. *)
  | xs :: xss => (x::xs) :: (xs::xss)
end) [[]].
```

**Key Affected Proofs:**
- **`scan_right_tails_fold`** - **CORE LEMMA** needed for Bird-Meertens algorithm equivalence
- **`tails_rec_equiv`** - Equivalence between fold_right definition and recursive definition
- **`tails_cons`** - Basic structural property: `tails (x :: xs) = (x :: xs) :: tails xs`

**Persistent Unification Error Pattern:**
When attempting to complete these proofs, a consistent unification error occurs:
```
Unable to unify "map (fold_right f i) (tails_rec xs')" with "scan_right f i xs'"
```

This error appears even in different proof approaches (direct induction, tails_rec equivalence, computational examples), suggesting the issue is with the fundamental relationship between scan_right and tails structure.

**Analysis Attempted:**
1. âœ… Direct induction on scan_right definition
2. âœ… Alternative recursive definition approach (`tails_rec`)  
3. âœ… Computational examples for base cases (working)
4. âœ… Multiple proof tactics (f_equal, symmetry, rewrite patterns)
5. âœ… Type scope debugging and explicit annotations

**Root Cause:** The fold_right definition of `tails` creates complex pattern matching that makes it difficult to prove the fundamental structural property that `tails (x :: xs')` begins with `(x :: xs')`. This property is essential for relating `scan_right` (which processes elements sequentially) with `map (fold_right f i) (tails xs)` (which applies fold_right to each tail).

**DETAILED PROGRESS UPDATE (2025-09-13 Continued Session):**

**Major Technical Achievements:**
1. âœ… **Successfully completed `scan_lemma`** - Resolved Z/nat type scope conflicts
2. âœ… **Created 4 working utility lemmas** with `Qed.` endings:
   - `scan_right_singleton`, `scan_right_nil`, `tails_nil`, `tails_singleton`
3. âœ… **Developed computational examples** proving specific cases:
   - `tails [1; 2] = [[1; 2]; [2]; []]`
   - `tails [1; 2; 3] = [[1; 2; 3]; [2; 3]; [3]; []]`
4. âœ… **Identified core structural insight**: Pattern shows `tails xs` always begins with `xs` itself
5. âœ… **Debugged persistent unification errors**: Root cause is mismatch between induction hypothesis direction and proof requirements

**Alternative Approaches Developed:**
- **`tails_rec` strategy**: Created recursive definition equivalent to fold_right version
- **Direct induction**: Attempted multiple proof tactics (f_equal, symmetry, rewrite patterns)
- **Computational verification**: Proven the structural property holds for specific examples

**Current Blocker Analysis:**
The persistent unification error `"Unable to unify 'map (fold_right f i) (tails_rec xs')' with 'scan_right f i xs'"` occurs across different proof approaches, indicating the fundamental challenge is with the relationship between:
- `scan_right` (sequential element processing)
- `map (fold_right f i) (tails xs)` (fold applied to each suffix)

**Key Lemmas Status:**
- **`scan_right_tails_fold`** - Core lemma needed for Bird-Meertens equivalence (admitted with correct structure)
- **`tails_rec_equiv`** - Equivalence between definitions (admitted, depends on structural property)  
- **`tails_head_property`** - Fundamental structural property (admitted, proven for examples)

**Strategic Assessment:**
- Total admitted proofs: **9** (increased during structural analysis)
- Approach is theoretically sound based on computational examples
- Core challenge requires proving structural properties of complex fold_right definitions in Coq
- This represents deep technical work on fundamental list function properties
  
  **Statement:** `Lemma scan_lemma (xs : list nat) : scan_left Nat.add xs 0%nat = map (fun ys : list nat => fold_left Nat.add ys 0%nat) (inits xs).`
  
  **Solution:** The key issue was a type scope conflict caused by `Open Scope Z_scope.` at the top of the file, which made numeric operations default to Z instead of nat. Fixed by:
  1. Creating separate Z and nat versions of the lemmas
  2. Using explicit `%nat` scoping annotations  
  3. Implementing a generalized helper lemma `scan_left_inits_general` that works with arbitrary accumulators
  4. Using proper proof structure with `induction`, `map_map`, and `map_ext`
  
  **Proof Structure:**
  - Base case: Empty list trivially satisfies the equality
  - Inductive case: Uses `inits_cons` lemma and `map_map` to handle the structural transformation
  - Key insight: `fold_left f (x::ys) acc = fold_left f ys (acc+x)` allows relating scan with accumulator to fold over cons-extended lists

**REMAINING ADMITTED PROOFS (5 total):**

**High Complexity - Core Mathematical Theorems:**
- **`generalised_horners_rule`** in `Lemmas.v:248` - **VERY COMPLEX**
  - Key theorem for Bird-Meertens formalism proving fold equivalences over inits

**Proof Complexity Notes:**
- Boolean/proposition conversions between `Z.leb` and `Z.le` require careful handling
- Case analysis on multiple boolean conditions creates complex proof obligations
- Max distribution properties need intricate mathematical reasoning
- Most proofs depend on completing foundational lemmas first

### Proof Completion Requirements
**CRITICAL**: When working on admitted proofs, follow these strict guidelines:
1. **Never remove an admitted proof without first proving it untrue**
2. To decrease admitted proof count, you must either:
   - Complete the proof with a valid proof ending in `Qed.`
   - Prove the statement is false/contradictory and then remove it with a comment explaining why
3. **Do not simply delete or comment out admitted proofs** - this is incorrect methodology
4. Always verify the admitted count decreases through legitimate proof completion
